Linear Regression from Scratch Project
This project showcases the implementation of linear regression from scratch using Python. The primary focus is on building a regression model, understanding the cost function, utilizing mean square error for optimization, and implementing the gradient descent algorithm.
Project Overview:
1. Building Linear Regression from Scratch:

    Objective: Implement linear regression using Python without relying on external libraries.
    Key Steps:
        Creation of a linear regression model.
        Definition and application of the cost function using mean square error.
        Optimization using the gradient descent algorithm.

2. Application on Titanic Dataset:

    Objective: Extend the implementation to a real-world scenario using the Titanic dataset.
    Key Steps:
        Application of gradient descent on the Titanic dataset.
        Utilization of scikit-learn library for comparison and validation.
